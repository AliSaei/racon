Consensus module for raw de novo DNA assembly of long uncorrected reads.

## Description
Racon is intended as a standalone consensus module to correct raw contigs generated by rapid assembly methods which do not include a consensus step. The goal of Racon is to generate genomic consensus which is of similar or better quality compared to the output generated by assembly methods which employ both error correction and consensus steps, while providing a speedup of several times compared to those methods. It supports data produced by both Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies.

Racon can be used as a polishing tool after the assembly with either Illumina data or data produced by third generation of sequencing. The type of data inputed is automatically detected.

Racon takes as input only three files: contigs in FASTA/FASTQ format, reads in FASTA/FASTQ format and overlaps/alignments between the reads and the contigs in MHAP/PAF/SAM format. Output is a set of polished contigs in FASTA format printed to stdout.

Racon can also be used as a read error-correction tool. In this scenario, the MHAP/PAF/SAM file needs to contain pairwise overlaps between reads without any dual or self overlaps.  

## Dependencies
1. gcc 4.8+ or clang 3.4+
2. cmake 3.2+

## Installation
To install Racon run the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/isovic/racon.git racon
cd racon
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

After successful installation, an executable named `racon` will appear in `build/bin`.

Optionally, you can run `sudo make install` to install racon executable to your machine.

***Note***: if you omitted `--recursive` from `git clone`, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` before proceeding with compilation.

## Usage
Usage of racon is as following:

    racon [options ...] <sequences> <overlaps> <target sequences>

        <sequences>
            input file in FASTA/FASTQ format containing sequences used for
            correction
        <overlaps>
            input file in MHAP/PAF/SAM format containing overlaps between
            sequences and target sequences
        <target sequences>
            input file in FASTA/FASTQ format containing sequences which will
            be corrected

    options:
        -u, --include-unpolished
            output unpolished target sequences (each sequence contains a tag in
            its header (C:<float>) which represents the percentage of polished
            windows)
        -f, --fragment-correction
            perform fragment correction instead of contig polishing (overlaps
            file should not contain dual/self overlaps!)
        -w, --window-length <int>
            default: 500
            size of window on which POA is performed
        -q, --quality-threshold <float>
            default: 10.0
            threshold for average base quality of windows used in poa
        -e, --error-threshold <float>
            default: 0.3
            maximum allowed error rate used for filtering overlaps
        -m, --match <int>
            default: 5
            score for matching bases
        -x, --mismatch <int>
            default: -4
            score for mismatching bases
        -g, --gap <int>
            default: -8
            gap penalty (must be negative)
        -t, --threads <int>
            default: 1
            number of threads
        --version
            prints the version number
        --help
            prints out the usage
